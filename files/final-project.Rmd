## Format


## Overview

For your final project, you will work in groups of up to three to research a topic related to the course material, develop and give a presentation on your findings, and write a brief report explaining your topic in an engaging and accessible manner.

* **Option 1a:** Imagine you are a consultant hired to audit automated decision systems. Choose a particular prediction algorithm/decision-making algorithm used by a company or a governmental agency. Identify potential ethical concerns and provide concrete recommendations for mitigating potential problems. Create a report/presentation detailing your findings.

* **Option 1b:** Imagine you are a researcher leading a government task force on accountability in algorithmic decision-making. Choose a particular prediction/decision-making problem for which algorithms are being used or developed. Identify potential ethical concerns and provide concrete recommendations for mitigating potential problems. Create a report/presentation detailing your findings.

* **Option 2:** Choose your own topic (have it approved by me before starting). Be creative--above all, you are encouraged to pursue topics that excite you. 

Project grades will be based on depth of analysis, research beyond course readings, quality of presentation, organization, and originality.
